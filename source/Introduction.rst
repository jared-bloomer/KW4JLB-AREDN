.. _Introduction:

AREDN Mesh Networks essentially are an "off grid" implementation of an Intranet of servers. AREDN Mesh Nodes find each other over several ways. They will automatically detect each other and link together. This can be done via RF (Radio Frequency) by pointing nodes towards each other. However local nodes can be connected by an Ethernet switch and they will automatically connect via Device To Device (D2D) detection. 

Behind the AREDN Mesh nodes can be servers, in many cases Raspberry Pis because of the small form factor and low power consumption, can run various services that can be exposed via the AREDN mesh nodes for users to connect to. Although it is not required to setup servers behinds the nodes.
